This repository hosts a comprehensive cheatsheet for `systemd`, the init system
and service manager for Linux operating systems. The cheatsheet is generated
from the `systemd_cheatsheet.tex` LaTeX file and serves as a quick reference
guide, ideally used in its PDF form.

It provides a valuable resource for users transitioning to `systemd` or those
needing a quick lookup for various commands.

Key areas covered in the cheatsheet include:

* A comparison of `systemd` commands with their traditional SysVinit counterparts
* Mappings of system runlevels to `systemd` targets
* A collection of useful commands for managing systemd services, units, and targets
* Information on viewing and managing logs using `journalctl`
* Equivalent `systemd` commands for common power management operations
